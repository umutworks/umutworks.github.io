The main contribution of this work is an extensive imitation of the behavior of a real fighter aircraft pilot using imitation learning and reinforcement learning. <br/> <br/>

In particular:

<ol>
    <li>A pilot behavior model was developed using only one demonstration from a real aircraft pilot on a real fighter aircraft.</li>
    <li>Based on this demo and using the open source F-16 model with NDI, a DAgger method has been developed that can generate as much expert data as needed to train imitation learning model.</li>
    <li>An imitation learning model is trained on F-16-NDI data to mimic pilot behavior</li>
    <li>The imitation model is tranfered to the Hurjet Aircraft using Tranfer Learning with expert pilot data</li>
    <li>A reinforcement learning method has been developed to transfer leaned behavior model to other aircrafts without using any expert data.</li>
    <li>Finally, a method has been developed that can be used to score or compare agile aircraft maneuvers.</li>
  </ol>
