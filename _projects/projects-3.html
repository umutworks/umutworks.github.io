The main contribution of this work is an extensive simulations of high accuracy vehicles and weapons systems using Monte Carlo simulations and development of machine learning algorithms for trajectory prediction.

In particular:

<ol>
    <li>Developed an algorithm to predict trajectory of adversarial units up to 5 minutes time horizon using Deep Learning and Probabilistic Methods.</li>
    <li>Using predicted trajectories implemented a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming algorithm to solve large scale Weapon Task Allocation Problems.</li>
    <li>Implemented Monte Carlo simulations of high-fidelity aircrafts, helicopters, missiles and UAVs.</li>
    <li>Developed an user interface for adversarial attack simulations and optimization environment for
      engagement decisions.</li>
</ol>
