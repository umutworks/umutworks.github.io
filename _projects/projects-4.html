In this work, we propose a novel missile guidance algorithm that combines deep learning based trajectory prediction with nonlinear model predictive control.  <br/> <br/>

In this paper, nonlinear model predictive control with target acceleration predictions (NMPC-TAP) method is proposed by exploiting target trajectory predictions generated by a deep neural network.
The main idea behind using deep neural networks for this purpose stems from the fact that a large array of past target trajectories are available from operational heuristics and domain expertise in air defense systems. <br/> <br/>

Target acceleration predictions are directly included in the NMPC scheme for propagating the interception problemâ€™s states. The NMPC formulates the interception problem as a QP problem in order to find the sub-optimal missile acceleration command. Simulations, which are conducted against an agile target to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrate that the desired guidance method is superior when compared to the others
