The goal of the competition, as stated in the RFP, is to design a space vehicle that will be operated from the Deep Space Gateway (DSG), which will be used as a staging point for the necessities of the spacecraft (i.e., refueling, assembly, reparation, etc.), will be able to transport a cargo of fifteen metric tons (15,000 kg) to the lunar surface and ten metric tons (10,000 kg) back to the DSG, or transfer a crew of four (4) to the lunar surface and return them. The ability to easily and swiftly reach the lunar surface is a stepping stone towards ultimate goal of deep space exploration. Therefore, this mission has an exceptional value for the future space operations. <br/> <br/>
