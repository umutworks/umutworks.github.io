I am a Graduate Researcher at [Istanbul Technical University(ITU)](http://itu.edu.tr/en) [Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Research Center](http://ai.itu.edu.tr/).

I received my MSc. and BSc. degree from [Istanbul Technical University](http://itu.edu.tr/en)**,** [Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://uubf.itu.edu.tr/en). At ITU, I was a graduate and undergraduate researcher at the [Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Research Center](http://ai.itu.edu.tr/) and [Aerospace Research Center, Control and Avionics Lab.](https://arc.itu.edu.tr)

I frequently collaborate with industry on research and product development projects. I have had the opportunity to work with [Aselsan](https://www.aselsan.com.tr/en), [Turkish Aerospace Inc.(TAI)](https://www.tusas.com/en), [Defence Industry Agency of Turkey](https://www.ssb.gov.tr/Default.aspx?LangID=2) so far. Besides my academic work, I am Co-founder and CEO of a space technology software startup [Orbyte Aerospace Technologies](https://www.orbytespace.com).

My primary research interests are:

**Machine Learning, Optimization, Data Driven Optimization**: Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Data-driven Decision Making Systems, Decision Making Under Uncertainty, Linear Programming.

**Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Multi-UAV Coordination and Trajectory
Planning Algorithms, Probabilistic Trajectory Prediction, Military and Civil Swarm Applications, Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning.

**High Accuracy Guidance, Navigation and Control**: Control System Design and Maneuver Planning for Agile
Fighter Aircraft, Guidance and Control of Ballistic and Interceptor Missiles, Orbital Mechanics, High-Accuracy
Simulations.

Besides my work, I play electric guitar with bands that usually lasts 3 months, mostly heavy stuff such as hardcore, metalcore, progressive metal genres. I enjoy playing both competitive and story based video games(Big fan of Overwatch and Red Dead Redemption 2). I like doing research outside my field, spending time with my loved ones and my super cute dog Akina.
