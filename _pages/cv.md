<h3> Turkish Aerospace Industries Inc.:Figther Aircraft Pilot Behavior Clonning   May 2020 - Jun 2022 </h3>

  <ul><li> Supervisor: Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nazım Kemal Ure</li> </ul> 

  This project focuses on development of deep neural network models for behavioral cloning of fighter aircraft maneuvers.

  We focus on active learning methods where the data is obtained from Hurjet Aircraft controlled by real fighter pilots with in an interactive manner.

  Our research utilizes Deep Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Transfer Learning, Curriculum Learning and Optimal Control Theory methods and the results show that our method can produce better agile maneuvers than real fighter pilots. Two Journal papers are on the way.
